// Diffrence Between StringBuffer And StringBuilder
// 1. StringBuffer: Due to synchronization, operations on StringBuffer are generally slower compared to StringBuilder when only a single thread is involved.
// 3.USECASE : 
        // StringBuffer: Use it when you need to modify strings in a multithreaded environment, and thread safety is required.
        // StringBuilder: Use it when you donâ€™t need thread safety (most of the time in single-threaded applications) and are looking for better performance.

        // inset char at index - it not remove pre char
