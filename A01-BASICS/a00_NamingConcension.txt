in java we use naming convention yo make code more readable

1. class and interfaces
   => for this we use camelCase but first char is capitle
   => Calc , ClassRoom

2. variables and mothods
   => for this we also use camelCase but first char is in small 
   => marks, totalMarks, showMyMarks()

3. constatns
   => for this all char are capitle and if word is large then we use underscore(_) to merge
   => PIE, BRAND, MY_DATA

4. constructor
  => for this first char is always capitle and same as class name
  => if class name is Student then it is = Student()
